# AI Chatbot on ESP with ONNX - Project Idea

## Project Title
AI Chatbot running ONNX models on ESP32 (or similar), communicating via serial

## Project Overview
Build a lightweight AI chatbot that runs a (tiny) ONNX model directly on an ESP32 or similar microcontroller. Communication with the AI bot happens over a serial connection (UART), so you can chat with your device from a PC terminal, Raspberry Pi, or another microcontroller.

## Key Features

- **ONNX Model Inference on ESP32:**  
  The ESP32 runs a (very small or quantized) ONNX model for AI chatbot capabilities.
- **Serial Communication:**  
  All interaction (sending questions, receiving answers) happens via UART (serial). Compatible with any terminal or serial monitor.
- **Open Source:**  
  Full source code provided with instructions for flashing and customization.
- **Simple Demo Included:**  
  Ready-to-use binaries and demo scripts to test the chatbot immediately.
- **Easy Model Swapping:**  
  Documentation/scripts for converting and uploading your own ONNX models (e.g. distilled/quantized chat-like models).
- **Integration Hints:**  
  Tips for connecting with Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, Raspberry Pi, and more.
- **Extensible:**  
  Designed to be a starting point for further expansion (other models, wireless communication, LCD interface, etc.).

## Motivation / Why Is This Cool?

- **AI on the Edge:**  
  Deploying AI models on cheap, popular microcontrollers is a hot topic and opens up many new applications.
- **Community Demand:**  
  Many makers and IoT enthusiasts want to run real AI on ESP32/ESP8266.
- **Viral Potential:**  
  "Chatting" with an ESP32 over serial is fun, easy to demo (gif/video), and can quickly catch the attention of AI/IoT communities.
- **Educational Value:**  
  Teaches about ONNX, model quantization, resource constraints, embedded ML, and serial protocols.

## Technical Challenges & Mitigations

- **Model Size Limitations:**  
  ESP32 has limited RAM/Flash. Use tiny/quantized ONNX models or stub-inference for the MVP.
- **ONNX Runtime:**  
  Porting ONNX runtime to ESP may require heavy trimming or custom inference code; consider starting with a basic operator subset.
- **Inference Speed:**  
  Keep models small for low latency, or precompute common responses as a fallback.
- **Serial Protocol:**  
  Define a simple, robust protocol for sending/receiving messages and handling errors/timeouts.
- **Cross-platform Usability:**  
  Provide clear instructions/scripts for Windows, Linux, macOS, and possible mobile serial connections.

## Project Structure / Roadmap

1. **Research & Feasibility**
    - Investigate ONNX inference on ESP32 (existing projects, operator support).
    - Explore available minimal/quantized chatbot models.
2. **Minimal Prototype**
    - Serial bridge (receive message, send dummy response).
    - Integration of a minimal ONNX model (stub if needed).
    - Proof of concept: Chat with the ESP via serial.
3. **Model Integration**
    - Support for loading and running a real ONNX model.
    - Scripts for model conversion/quantization.
4. **Demo & Docs**
    - Animated GIF/video demo.
    - Step-by-step instructions for flashing and chatting.
    - Troubleshooting and FAQ.
5. **Polish & Extensions**
    - Easy model swapping.
    - Support for more hardware (LCD, Wi-Fi, BLE).
    - Community contributions (e.g., model zoo, new features).

## Potential Impact

- Fun and hackable AI gadget for makers, students, and IoT enthusiasts.
- Useful template for anyone wanting to run AI on microcontrollers.
- Good candidate for trending on GitHub/Reddit/Hacker News due to uniqueness and demo-ability.
